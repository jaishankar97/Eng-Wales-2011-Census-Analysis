# England and Wales 2011 Census Analysis
The repository consists of python files used for the data preprocessing of the 2011 census data of England and Wales and revolves around the different stages which led to the successful completion of different analytical tasks using data visualizations.
	
Problem : 

England and Wales are known for people of mixed ethnicity and different cultures and religions living together in a society. The problem evolves around different categories i.e. a single person, or a family whether they are in the country or planning to immigrate from abroad. It depends on every person, their preferences of living standards whether they are in a favour of living in a mixed cultural environment or specific to their ethnicity or religion. Some may prefer living in a society full of people who are enthusiastic about maintaining a good physique and health, and some may prefer to locate at different places for work to a place having a particular type of professional demands. On the other hand, a family with or without children may also be concerned about the different age groups and the sex ratio of the neighbourhood they will be living in in the future apart from ethnicity, religion, and health factors.

The Python Files as specified by their names consists python scripts written/used to clean the data, each for their specific type of dataset. 

The CSV files are the dataset after cleaning and further used for creating visualisations using Tableau. The name suggests the type of Dashboards created and the particular field of problem it can solve. 

NOTE: The above analysis was done by me in the Visual Analytics module assesment in the degree MSc Data Science at the University of Bristol, UK.
